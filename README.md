These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## **Prerequisites**
1. Python 3.x
2. Pygame library
3. The fonts, images and audios used in the program

## **Running the Game**
Navigate to the project directory and run the following command in your terminal:
python3 Space_Invaders.py

## **How to Play**
1. Use the left and right arrow keys to move the player left and right.

## **Customization**
You can customize the game in different ways such as:
1. Change the graphics: You can replace the graphics with your own images or find new ones online. You can also change the colors and fonts used in the game.
2. Adjust the difficulty: You can modify the difficulty by changing the speed of the aliens, the frequency of their shots, or the number of lives the player has.
3. Add power-ups: You can add power-ups to the game that give the player extra lives, faster bullets, or other advantages.
4. Implement different game modes: You can create different game modes, such as a survival mode where the player has to survive as long as possible against an endless wave of aliens, or a time trial mode where the player has to defeat the aliens as quickly as possible.
5. Add multiplayer: You can add a multiplayer mode where two players compete against each other to see who can defeat the aliens first.
